23/06/20,Microsoft,"""blm""","""Statement,blm""","An email from CEO Satya Nadella to Microsoft employees: As I shared in our Employee Town Hall last month, and in my email earlier this month, we are committed to take action to help address racial injustice and inequity, and unequivocally believe that Black lives matter. Below you will see many of the steps we are taking. Over the past several weeks, the senior leadership team, board of directors, and I have spent time reflecting, listening, learning, and discussing what role the company – and all of us collectively – must play in helping to drive change, both within Microsoft and in our communities. With significant input from employees and leaders who are members of the Black and African American community, we have developed a set of actions that we believe are both meaningful to improving the lived experience at Microsoft, as well as driving change in the communities in which we live and work. Today, we are making commitments to address racial injustice and inequity for the Black and African American community in the United States. We will additionally take important steps to address the needs of other communities, including the Hispanic and Latinx community, across the company in the next five years. We are focused on three multiyear, sustained efforts: Increasing our representation and culture of inclusion. We will build on our diversity and inclusion (D&I) momentum from the past five years by adding an additional $150M of D&I investment, and will double the number of Black and African American people managers, senior individual contributors, and senior leaders in the United States by 2025. Engaging our ecosystem. We will use our balance sheet and engagement with suppliers and partners to extend the vision for societal change throughout our ecosystem, creating new opportunities for them and the communities they serve. Strengthening our communities. We will use the power of data, technology, and partnership to help improve the lives of Black and African American citizens across our country, including to address the safety and well-being of our own employees in the communities in which they live. Below are key details on how we will accomplish this. Our Culture We need to ensure that our culture of inclusion is a top priority for everyone. It starts with our values of respect, integrity, and accountability. Each of us must be able to thrive in diverse teams. Every manager must be able to attract, retain, and grow employees of all backgrounds. This is certainly true at Microsoft, and also more broadly. It is the new baseline for manager excellence across industries across the globe. We will meet this new goal in three key ways: We will accelerate our cultural transformation through further investment in inclusion. Managers who have a deep understanding and commitment to building inclusive culture are key to our company’s success. Starting in FY21, our training on allyship, covering, and privilege in the workplace will be required for all employees, with additional new content on understanding the experience of the Black and African American community. Because leadership sets the tone, we will have required live sessions for CVPs and EVPs to ensure they better understand the lived experience of these specific communities. We will strengthen our intentional career planning and talent development efforts. This will apply across our workforce, beginning with Black and African American employees. These programs will expand to include other employee groups as we learn and grow. We will expand on our leadership development programs for select Black and African American midlevel employees and their managers, to help prepare for promotion to Director/Principal. For Director/Principal level, we will create a new development opportunity to expose them to the leadership expectations of the Partner/GM level and match them with senior-level sponsors and mentors. For Partner/GMs, we are continuing to invest in the dedicated leadership development programs. We will further strengthen company accountability for progress on representation. We will deepen our practice of evaluating each CVP/GM’s progress on diversity and inclusion when determining their impact and rewards, as well as promotion considerations. We will provide CVPs with dedicated D&I coaches to confront and resolve systemic obstacles within their organizations. We will expand our global, quarterly promotion process to ensure we build diverse leadership teams at all levels. This will include direct engagement with business leaders on review of all candidates for people management, Director/Principal level, and Partner/GM level. Our Ecosystem A vast business ecosystem surrounds Microsoft from our supply chain to our partner community. We recognize that a stronger and more productive ecosystem requires better representation of the diversity in our communities. We will evolve our engagement with our supply chain, banking partners, and the broad Microsoft partner ecosystem in this effort. We will double the number of Black- and African American-owned approved suppliers over the next three years and spend an incremental $500M with those existing and new suppliers. We’ll do this by ensuring our existing guidance to include diverse minority-owned suppliers in all RFPs is well understood, evaluate supplier portfolio composition, and enhance the weighting of diversity characteristics (both in ownership and in broad workforce) during the supplier evaluation and selection process. We will also encourage Black and African American representation progress in our top 100 suppliers, which account for over 50 percent of our indirect spend, by requesting annual disclosure of their diversity profile information (e.g., workforce diversity, goals) that we will incorporate into our RFP evaluations. We will use our own banking needs to grow our portfolio investment activity with Black- and African American-owned financial institutions. Over the next three years, we will double the percentage of our transaction volumes through these Black- and African-American owned banks and external managers where we have existing strong banking relationships and look to grow that base, which provides an increased opportunity for these firms to attract more capital. We will create a $100M program that will make its initial investment in collaboration with the FDIC to target Minority Owned Depository Institutions (MDIs), which directly enables an increase of funds into local communities (businesses, restaurants, housing, etc.). And, we will establish a $50M investment fund focused on supporting Black- and African American-owned small businesses. The fund will initially focus on investing to improve access to capital, increase skill development, and reduce the technology gaps that exist today. We know how important partners are to the growth of our business. We look forward to investing to increase the number of Black- and African American-owned partners in our US partner community by 20 percent over the next three years. A new $50M partner fund will help with access to capital providing loans to support these partners through their startup phase with the loans recovered over time as their business grows. We will provide $20M of financing to existing and new partners to support their cashflow needs. And, we will invest an additional $3M in training programs covering financial management, tech solutions, and go-to-market readiness. Our Communities No company can change the world by itself. But we believe that Microsoft can put the power of data, technology, and partnership to work to help improve the lives of Black and African American citizens across our country. That’s what we’re committed to doing, through a four-part effort. We will strengthen and expand our existing justice reform initiative with a five-year, $50 million sustained effort. Since starting this work in 2017, we’ve come to appreciate the importance of this issue not only to the nation, but to the personal lives of our employees and their families. No one should have to live with the fear of being stopped by the police, harassed while shopping, or bullied in school because of the color of their skin. This conviction has led us to do increasing work advocating both in the Puget Sound and nationally, including in the communities where our employees live.We will build on this foundation by using data and digital technology toward increased transparency and accountability in our justice system. All this work will be backed by public policy advocacy that will increase access to data to identify racial disparities and improve policing. We’ll also use our technology and expertise to support evidenced-based and unbiased diversion programs that direct people into treatment alternatives instead of incarceration. We’ll also use data to promote racial equity in the decisions made by prosecutors, including decisions about who to charge with a crime, the nature of the charge, plea offers, and sentencing recommendations. We will expand our skills work to help Black and African American students and adults develop the skills needed to succeed in the digital economy. Over the next five years, we will expand in 13 states and the District of Columbia the Microsoft TEALS industry volunteer program to bring computer science education to an additional 620 high schools primarily serving Black and African American students. We will also strengthen Microsoft’s support for Historically Black Colleges and Universities, including in computer and data science programs, campus initiatives and partnerships, and curriculum development. Finally, we’ll offer digital skills training to Black and African American adults seeking new jobs. As part of a global skilling initiative, we will provide $5 million in cash grants to community-based nonprofit organizations led by and serving communities of color, enabling them to better support digital skills programs. We will help expand access to broadband and devices for communities of color and the key institutions that support them in major urban centers, by working with carriers, OEMs, our own hardware team, refurbishers, and nonprofits to enrich low-cost broadband access by providing affordable PCs and Microsoft software. We’ll work to ensure these services can be put to effective use to improve people’s lives, with a focus on telehealth services and educational offerings. Backed by public advocacy, we’ll start by focusing on six cities that currently confront the largest urban broadband gaps. Finally, we will increase technology support for nonprofits that support and are led by people of color. We will help support the digital transformation that we know from experience can make nonprofits more effective. We’ll provide access to Azure and Dynamics credits and financial grants that will enable these organizations to add the IT staff needed to better deploy and maximize technology. We look forward to tapping into the knowledge and expertise of our own employees as we identify effective groups we can support more strongly. Change begins by looking inward. We expect this change in ourselves. Employees expect this change from their leaders. Our customers and partners expect this change from Microsoft. And the world demands this change. This is not a one-time event. It will require real work and focus. We will listen and learn. We will take feedback and we will adjust. But it starts with each of us making a commitment to do the work, to help drive change, and to act with intention.

11/6/2020,Fannie Mae,"""blm""","""Statement,blm""","George Floyd’s death, and the many similar incidents of abuse and brutality affecting Black people and other people of color, underscore the need for self-reflection by both individuals and institutions in our country. Fannie Mae understands the story of housing in America includes a history of systemic racism. Our role in housing finance brings important responsibilities. We are committed to doing all that we can to support a housing finance system that is free of racism, while also recognizing that Black people and other people of color all too frequently continue to suffer from racist housing policies and practices. We look forward to partnering with those across the housing sector who have the commitment, resources, and energy to make lasting change. Fairness and equality of opportunity are central to Fannie Mae’s affordable housing mission, and respect, diversity, and inclusion are cornerstones of our culture. On behalf of Fannie Mae, I pledge that we will continue to ask how our actions as a company do or do not live up to these values. We affirm our commitment to racial justice and inclusion. We are also humble enough to know that we can do more. And we will. I also want to share a message that Fannie Mae President David Benson and I sent to employees on May 29, 2020. Message from Hugh Frater, CEO, and Dave Benson, President May 29, 2020 Dear Colleagues: Over the past few days, the sadness of this moment in our history has become even sadder. Against the backdrop of a global pandemic bringing death to hundreds of thousands, the world is now witness to the terrible images surrounding the death of George Floyd, and related protests in Minneapolis and other cities across the country. Our sadness today is not just for the Floyd family but for our larger human family. So many of the pictures we’ve seen this week – and in other recent weeks – are hard to watch. They are shocking. In many cases, they starkly underscore the cruelty of individual acts of hatred and the consequences of indifference to racism in too many parts of our society. More broadly, this week reminds us again of the distance between the American ideals we aspire to, and the daily realities of life for too many Americans, especially people of color. We are fortunate to work at a company with a social mission rooted in fair and equal opportunity, respect, diversity, and inclusion. But we need to be honest about the disparities we know exist in our society, and diligent in continually finding ways to ensure that the values we espouse come to life in our workplace. Like many things, this is especially challenging while we’re working remotely, but there are tools that can help. These include many training opportunities (including about issues in Our Code), our Courageous Conversations series that provide a safe space for discussion, counseling resources available through our Employee Assistance Program, and the many activities and programs of our Employee Resources Groups (ERGs), including the African Ancestry Business Leaders for Excellence (ABLE) ERG. We have discussed this week’s events with the other leaders on the Management Committee. We are united in our commitment to the hard work of not just opposing overt acts of racism, but of using this time to proactively advance diversity and inclusion within Fannie Mae. We also recognize that while the events in Minneapolis shock the consciences of all, they touch our African American employees in particular and painful ways. For now, we must continue to be distant from our offices. But let’s use this period to grow closer as a community and to live our values to their fullest. These times are hard. But let them steel us to meet the great challenges of this moment. Hugh & Dave",https://www.fanniemae.com/newsroom/fannie-mae-news/statement-fannie-mae-ceo-hugh-r-frater,null
2/6/2020,Bank of america,"""blm""","""Statement,blm""","Bank of America announced today that it is making a $1 billion, four-year commitment of additional support to help local communities address economic and racial inequality accelerated by a global pandemic. The programs will be focused on assisting people and communities of color that have experienced a greater impact from the health crisis. “Underlying economic and social disparities that exist have accelerated and intensified during the global pandemic,” said CEO Brian Moynihan. “The events of the past week have created a sense of true urgency that has arisen across our nation, particularly in view of the racial injustices we have seen in the communities where we work and live. We all need to do more.” The work builds on economic mobility and workforce development programs Bank of America already supports in local markets, but will sharpen the focus of that work, accelerate the resources, and add a particular emphasis on health services during the pandemic. The announcement is aligned with the company’s commitment to responsible growth for clients, shareholders, employees and communities. Areas of focus will be: Health Jobs/Training/Reskilling/Upskilling Support to Small Businesses Housing The programs will be executed through the company’s 90 local U.S. market presidents and non-U.S. country executives to help develop the opportunities to execute on these commitments in areas that include: Virus testing, telemedicine, flu vaccination clinics, and other health services, with a special focus on communities of color. Partnerships with historically black colleges and universities and Hispanic-serving institutions in the United States for hiring, research programs, and other areas of mutual opportunity. Support to minority-owned small businesses, including clients and vendors. Career reskilling/upskilling through partnerships with high schools and community colleges. Operating support and investment for affordable housing/neighborhood revitalization, leveraging our nearly $5 billion in Community Development Banking. Further recruitment and retention of teammates in low-to-moderate-income and disadvantaged communities to build on work the company has already done to serve clients locally. This work builds on steps the company has already taken, including an additional $100 million to support its nonprofit partners across its communities, and $250 million to assist with lending to the smallest and minority-owned businesses through its support to community development financial and minority depository institutions.",https://newsroom.bankofamerica.com/press-releases/bank-america-announces-four-year-1-billion-commitment-supporting-economic,null
1/6/2020,Home Depot,"""blm""","""Statement,blm""","We are all confronting deep pain and anguish over the senseless killing of George Floyd, Ahmaud Arbery and other unarmed Black men and women in our country. We cannot ignore that their deaths are part of a pattern of racism and reflect the harsh reality that as a nation we are much too far from fulfilling the promise of equal justice for all.  We must stand with all who are committed to change that will bring us closer to realizing an end to discrimination and hatred. To promote actionable change, The Home Depot is contributing $1 million to the Lawyers Committee for Civil Rights Under Law in support of its vital work to secure civil rights and equal justice for all. Its mission is especially critical now as we work to build a more inclusive society. Over our company’s history, we have built an environment where we take care of each other, build strong relationships and value respect for all people. As I did in my note on Saturday, I want to thank our 400,000-plus associates for helping to uphold our values.  Diversity and respect for all people are core to who we are as an Orange-Blooded family. We do not support discrimination in any form, period. We are all hurting, but none more acutely than those in our African American communities. Please know that you are not alone. We must work together and more urgently. To that end, I have begun working with our associate resource groups to facilitate internal town halls to share experiences and create better understanding among us all. We are dedicated to supporting you and our communities during this time with the goal of emerging more united than ever.",https://corporate.homedepot.com/newsroom/message-craig-menear-%E2%80%93-racial-equality-justice-all,null

8/6/2020,Comcast,"""blm""","""Statement,blm""","We know that Comcast alone can’t remedy this complex issue. But you have my commitment that our company will try to play an integral role in driving lasting reform. Together, we hope to help create a more equitable, just and inclusive society. To that end, we are developing a comprehensive, multiyear plan to allocate $100 million to fight injustice and inequality against any race, ethnicity, gender identity, sexual orientation or ability. There will be $75 million in cash and $25 million in media that will be distributed over the next three years, in addition to the existing commitments our company currently makes to thousands of organizations supporting underrepresented communities through our Comcast NBCUniversal Foundation and social impact programs. Craig Robinson, EVP and Chief Diversity Officer for NBCUniversal, will be spearheading these efforts with me at the corporate level and will coordinate with business leaders across Comcast, NBCUniversal and Sky to build programs, allocate resources and partner with national and local organizations to drive meaningful change. Each of our companies will create sustainable programs within their businesses and will be proactively soliciting ideas from employees so that we can build this effort together. We will share more about these initiatives and our plans in the weeks ahead, but today we want to outline our key focus areas:Social JusticeWe will partner with, and provide significant grants to, organizations working to eradicate injustice and inequity. Organizations will include but not be limited to: the National Urban League, the Equal Justice Initiative, the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, the National Action Network and the Community Justice Action Fund.EmployeesWe will accelerate our efforts in all areas of Diversity & Inclusion, including advancement, hiring and training. We will educate everyone across the company to better understand race-related issues and have the important conversations – however uncomfortable – through Town Halls, speaker series and mandatory anti-racism and anti-bias training. We will provide additional financial support to our Employee Resource Groups and invest in our diverse talent, providing them with visibility, opportunity and sponsorship, while continuing to strengthen our diversity recruiting strategy. Together, we aim to encourage racial sensitivity and eradicate explicit and implicit bias in the workplace at all levels across Comcast, NBCUniversal and Sky.Media, Awareness and EducationWe will put the full weight of our company’s media resources behind highlighting Black voices and Black stories and educating our viewers on diverse and inclusive cultures, perspectives and experiences, by making anti-racism education and inequality awareness a Symphony priority. We will use our platforms across the organization to continue to shed light on societal issues related to race. NBC News will host a series of Town Halls, similar to their ‘Can You Hear Us Now’ special that aired this past Tuesday, and we will use the X1, Flex, Peacock and Sky platforms to promote and amplify multicultural content.Digital EquityWe will deepen our company’s long-standing commitment to addressing digital inequities, which disproportionately impact communities of color. Over the last 10 years, Comcast’s Internet Essentials has connected more than eight million low-income people to the internet at home. Beyond connectivity, we are scaling up our pledge to provide digital skills training to young people and to upskilling adults with the aim of improving economic mobility. Supporting organizations such as Black Girls Code, which empowers girls of color to become innovators in STEM fields, and BUILD, which ignites the potential of young people from under-resourced communities, are two examples.Small Business OpportunityWe will commit funds to help small businesses that have been affected by extended closures in the wake of COVID-19, allocating a substantial portion of those funds to businesses owned by people of color. Comcast Business and Effectv will support businesses impacted by the events of the last few months and provide airtime and commercial production when they are ready to open. Additionally, we will create new LIFT Labs programs for Black founders, invest in diverse entrepreneurs through Comcast Ventures and our accelerators and expand the Catalyst program, which focuses on investing in Black, Latinx and female entrepreneurs.BRIAN L. ROBERTSChairman and Chief Executive Officer Comcast Corporation June 8, 2020I want to sincerely thank those of you who have reached out and courageously shared your experiences and fears. We look forward to hearing more of your insightful ideas for our path ahead to a better future. Together we are facing a painful yet powerful moment – one that presents us with a renewed opportunity to do better, and to create substantive and sustainable change.",https://corporate.comcast.com/commitment,null

19/06/2020,Wells Fargo,"""blm""","""Statement,blm""","Wells Fargo CEO Charlie Scharf announced on Tuesday a series of commitments to ensure the company’s ongoing diversity and inclusion efforts result in meaningful change. “‘Black Lives Matter’ is a statement that the inequality and discrimination that has been so clearly exposed is terribly real, though it is not new, and must not continue,” Scharf said in a letter to employees. “The pain and frustration with the lack of progress within both our country and Wells Fargo is clear. I personally, and we as a senior team, are working to develop actions that will meaningfully contribute to the change that is necessary. This time must be different.” Among the commitments Scharf announced: Representation: Wells Fargo is committed to doubling Black leadership over the next five years. Currently among the company’s senior leadership, 41% are female, and 21% are racially or ethnically diverse; 6% are Black/African American. The company will aggressively recruit senior managers from outside the company, which will in turn better position Wells Fargo to promote from within for its top leadership roles. Compensation: Senior leadership will be evaluated based upon their progress in improving diverse representation and inclusion in their area of responsibility, which will have a direct impact on year-end compensation decisions. New and expanded diversity role reporting to the CEO: This is a new role which will have a broad mandate of driving diversity and inclusion in both Wells Fargo’s workplace and business, including working with business leaders to drive investments in products and solutions specifically for diverse populations across our country. Wells Fargo education sessions: The company will begin a series of education sessions in which employees can share with colleagues their personal stories and perspectives on the realities of racism in our country. All employees will be able to participate. New live anti-racism manager training: All managers will be required to participate in a new live and interactive program specifically designed to tackle today’s challenges. This will go well beyond the current standardized training that is inadequate to the challenge. Senior leadership will go through this training first, and then it will cascade throughout the company. Additionally, in March, Scharf announced a series of expanded actions the company is undertaking to accelerate efforts to build a more diverse and inclusive workforce. Among the commitments: A focus on recruitment, hiring, and promotions to increase diverse representation in senior-level roles, particularly with female and racially/ethnically diverse employees. A “returnship” program focused on diverse talent who have been out of the workforce for an extended period to support their return to the industry. A formal development program for high-potential employees to build a more diverse and inclusive talent pipeline. More responsibility for senior leaders to sponsor and lead diversity-focused programs. A consistent and regular way to measure diversity and inclusion progress across the company. A focus on expanding our diverse supplier pipeline by exploring opportunities with diverse asset managers and other business partners. Supporting Black businesses These commitments are in addition to recently announced business initiatives, including investing up to $50 million in African American Minority Depository Institutions as part of Wells Fargo’s commitment to supporting economic growth in African American communities. In April, the company also announced that it will donate the fees it would otherwise receive from the Paycheck Protection Program to support small businesses, particularly those owned by Black and African Americans and by other entrepreneurs of color. Scharf also noted that these actions are just a part of a larger Wells Fargo commitment to diversity and inclusion, which he noted goes beyond the issues around racial justice that these commitments are intended to begin addressing. “We know that we can be a force for change across this country,” Scharf said. “I do believe that this will be a watershed moment where we change the outcomes and we will be part of that change.”",https://stories.wf.com/wells-fargo-ceo-a-watershed-moment/,null
