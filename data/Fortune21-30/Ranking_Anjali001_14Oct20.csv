2020,21,Microsoft,"Microsoft reached its highest ranking ever on the Fortune 500, up five spots from last year, and churned out $39 billion in profits to boot. In Microsoft’s fiscal 2019, overall sales soared 14% year-over-year, to $125.8 billion. Last fall, the software titan won a coveted cloud-computing contract with the Pentagon worth up to $10 billion, a deal that would help solidify Microsoft’s reputation as a leading cloud vendor. (That deal is on hold and under review, however, after rival bidder Amazon raised questions about the bidding process.) So far in 2020, a surge in remote working as a result of the coronavirus pandemic has led to even greater demand for the company’s Azure cloud service and its Office 365 workplace apps. Microsoft’s shares hit an all-time high in February at nearly $189, underscoring Wall Street’s enthusiasm for the company's evolution under CEO Satya Nadella."
2020,22,Marathon Petroleum,"While much of the energy sector struggled with faltering oil prices, the U.S.’s largest independent refiner eked out gains by processing crude into industrial products.That pushed up revenue 28.4% in 2019 even as net income remained flat. Still, the Ohio-based business had a tumultuous year. It purchased Andeavor, a move that expanded its reach as a refiner, but failed to live up to Marathon's expectations. Activist investors, meanwhile, renewed demands for a management shakeup. They also pushed for a review of the company's pipeline and storage operations, as well as the planned spin-off of its retail Speedway business. Amid the turmoil, the company’s long-time CEO plans to retire this year."
2020,23,Kroger,"Kroger has performed consistently amid stiff competition from the likes of Walmart, which already has an outsize share of U.S. grocery sales, and Amazon, which is making increasing inroads into the segment. Kroger's same-store sales edged ahead 2% in 2019, which is about average for U.S. grocers, while operating profits increased 7.5%. After a slow start in ecommerce, the Cincinnati-based company has been investing to ramp up its online operations through a partnership with U.K. grocer Ocado. It aims to eventually have 20 highly automated fulfilment centers operating across the U.S. The first three of these warehouses—in Ohio, Georgia and Florida—are due to open in 2021. At least one prominent investor likes Kroger’s prospects: Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway revealed it had taken a 2.4% stake in the grocer in the fourth quarter."
2020,24,Fannie Mae,"Government–backed Fannie Mae remains a vital cog in the U.S. housing market. Fannie provided more than $650 billion in liquidity to the residential mortgage market last year across more than 3 million home purchases, re-financings, and rentals. In addition to financing roughly one in four single-family mortgages in the U.S., the company provided $70 billion in multifamily financing in 2019, with the overwhelming bulk of that backing affordable units. Revenues ticked up 1% last year; profits, however, were harder to come by. They slid 11%."
2020,25,Bank of america,"Bank of America made Warren Buffett proud in 2019. As consumers propped up the economy during the year, BofA benefitted from having doubled down on its consumer businesses. Shares rose 46% over the course of the year and added billions in value for Berkshire Hathaway, the company's largest shareholder. Even net interest income, which normally suffers when interest rates are low, rose 2% during the year, to $48.9 billion, as the bank focused on making a higher volume of loans while keeping expenses flat."
2020,26,Home Depot,"The home improvement leader has continued to best its competitors—including Lowe’s. Credit both the ongoing effort to spruce up store brands and new technology tools that let store workers see a fuller picture of a shopper’s spending history and offering them insights for upselling. The company's e-commerce operation grew more than 20% last year. Home Depot has also gingerly expanded its assortment, dipping its toes into home furnishings and decor, to get more spending from each shopper visit. While the housing market could be heading for bumpy times in a recession, Home Depot appears to be gathering the tools it needs to keep outperforming rivals."
2020,27,Phillips 66,"Phillips66 continued to expand in 2019, extending its network of pipelines. It announced an $8 billion joint petrochemical venture with Chevron and Qatar Petroleum, and pushed for an offshore export terminal in the Gulf of Mexico. The Houston-based refiner was not hiding its ambition: it wanted to go all-in on the U.S. shale boom. But relatively weak prices in 2019 helped push the company’s adjusted earnings down by about 34% from last year's figure, to $3.7 billion. Across the oil sector, 2020 started with a jolt. The January price spike gave way to the coronavirus-fueled price crash, which quickly led refineries to cut back production rates."
2020,28,Comcast,"This year marked the first time Comcast included British pay TV provider Sky, an acquisition it made in 2018, in its full-year report, helping the cable company grow its revenue by 15% in 2019. Demand for high-speed internet also boosted the 57-year-old company’s earnings. Comcast added a total of 442,000 new Internet customers in the fourth quarter of 2019 alone, helping to offset declines in video and voice subscriptions. But numbers were also down across the company’s NBCUniversal division, with declines in cable networks, broadcast TV, and filmed entertainment contributing to a 5% overall revenue drop in the segment."
2020,29,Anthem,"Anthem is the largest for-profit health insurer in the sprawling Blue Cross Blue Shield federation—a compendium that includes 36 independent and locally-operated companies. In 2019, the company seized on a growth opportunity by officially launching its new pharmacy benefits arm, IngenioRx. Anthem president and CEO Gail Boudreaux, who was appointed to the top perch in late 2017, has emphasized the importance of that move, citing it as the main driver for the firm’s nearly 13% increase in year-over-year operating revenue. However, as with most major health insurers, a special tax waiver for 2019 boosted Anthem’s numbers. The company has about 41 million insured members across more than two dozen states."
2020,30,Wells Fargo,"Three years after Wells Fargo's fake accounts scandal erupted, the cleanup continues. There have been countless lawsuits, two CEO exits (three, if you count the departure of an interim leader), and, this February, a new $3 billion fine to resolve further investigations. A $1.95 trillion asset cap on Wells Fargo, imposed by the Federal Reserve in 2018, continues to limit the bank’s growth compared with its peers. Now, CEO Charles Scharf, who joined in October 2019, is tasked with reforming Wells Fargo’s image in the eyes of consumers and regulators alike. Scharf, a former CEO of Bank of New York Mellon, and before that, Visa, is the first top leader brought in from outside Wells Fargo in more than a century; so far he has reorganized reporting lines and brought in more outside executives."
