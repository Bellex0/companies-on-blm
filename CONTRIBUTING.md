## Introduction

You are here to help on companies-on-blm? Awesome, feel welcome and read the following sections in order to know how to ask questions and how to work on something.
All members of our community are expected to follow our [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/DiversityCorp/companies-on-blm/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). Please make sure you are welcoming and friendly in all of our spaces.

Following these guidelines helps to communicate that you respect the time of the developers managing and developing this open source project. In return, they should reciprocate that respect in addressing your issue, assessing changes, and helping you finalize your pull requests.

There are many ways to contribute, from writing blog posts, improving the documentation, submitting bug reports and feature requests or writing code which can be incorporated into the project itself.

## Ground rules

Code and documentation contributions are welcome via GitHub pull requests.

For all contributions, please respect the following guidelines:

* Each pull request should implement ONE feature or bugfix. If you want to add or fix more than one thing, submit more than one pull request.
* Do not commit changes to files that are irrelevant to your feature or bugfix (e.g., `.gitignore`).
* Be willing to accept criticism and work on improving your code.
* Be aware that the pull request review process is not immediate, and is generally proportional to the size of the pull request.
* Be welcoming to newcomers and encourage diverse new contributors from all backgrounds.
